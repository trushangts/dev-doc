# EC2 instance using FileZilla 

### Prerequisites:

1. **Download and Install FileZilla:**
   - Download and install [FileZilla Client](https://filezilla-project.org/download.php).

2. **Private Key (.pem) File:**
   - Ensure you have the private key (.pem) file that corresponds to the key pair used when launching your EC2 instance.

### Steps:

#### 1. Open FileZilla:

- Launch FileZilla on your local machine.

#### 2. Configure Site in FileZilla:

1. **Open Site Manager:**
   - Navigate to `File -> Site Manager` or press `Ctrl + S` on Windows or `Cmd + S` on Mac.

2. **Add New Site:**
   - Click on the "New Site" button and give your site a name.

3. **Configure Connection:**
   - Set the following parameters:
     - **Host:** Your Elastic IP or public DNS of the EC2 instance.
     - **Port:** 22 (SFTP uses port 22 by default).
     - **Protocol:** SFTP - SSH File Transfer Protocol.
     - **Logon Type:** Key file.
     - **User:** ec2-user (or the username associated with your instance).

4. **Add Private Key:**
   - Click on the "Connect" tab.
   - In the "Key file" field, browse and select your private key (.pem) file.

#### 3. Connect to EC2 Instance:

1. **Connect:**
   - Click on the "Connect" button.

2. **Verify Host Key:**
   - If prompted to trust the host key, click "OK."

3. **FileZilla Interface:**
   - You should now be connected to your EC2 instance. The left side represents your local files, and the right side shows the files on your EC2 instance.

#### 4. Transfer Files:

1. **Upload/Download Files:**
   - Use drag-and-drop or the file transfer buttons to upload/download files between your local machine and the EC2 instance.

2. **Navigate Directories:**
   - Navigate through directories on both local and remote sides.

### Notes:

- Make sure your private key file has the correct permissions. You can set it to read-only for the owner using:
  ```bash
  chmod 400 path/to/your/key.pem
  ```

- If you encounter issues connecting, ensure that your security group allows traffic on port 22 (SSH) for your EC2 instance.

This guide should help you set up FileZilla for connecting to your EC2 instance via SFTP. Adjust the settings based on your specific configurations and security measures.
