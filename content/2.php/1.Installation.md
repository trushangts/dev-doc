Installing multiple versions of PHP on Ubuntu with a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) setup can be achieved using the `ondrej/php` repository, which provides different PHP versions as well as the ability to switch between them easily. Here are the steps to install multiple versions of PHP on your Ubuntu machine:

**Note:** The following steps assume you already have a LAMP stack installed on your system.

1. **Add the ondrej/php repository:**
   ```bash
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

2. **Install PHP versions:**
   Install the desired PHP versions. For example, if you want to install PHP 7.4 and PHP 8.0, you can use the following commands:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install php7.4
   sudo apt-get install php8.0
   ```

3. **Install necessary PHP extensions:**
   You may need to install additional PHP extensions for each version you install. For example:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install php7.4-mysql php7.4-xml
   sudo apt-get install php8.0-mysql php8.0-xml
   ```

4. **Switch between PHP versions:**
   You can use the `update-alternatives` command to switch between different PHP versions. For example, to switch to PHP 7.4:
   ```bash
   sudo update-alternatives --set php /usr/bin/php7.4
   ```

   To switch to PHP 8.0:
   ```bash
   sudo update-alternatives --set php /usr/bin/php8.0
   ```

5. **Restart Apache:**
   After switching the PHP version, restart Apache to apply the changes:
   ```bash
   sudo service apache2 restart
   ```

6. **Verify PHP version:**
   You can verify the PHP version in the command line or by creating a `phpinfo.php` file in your web server's document root with the following content:
   ```php
   <?php phpinfo(); ?>
   ```

   Open the file in a web browser, and it will show you the PHP version.

Repeat these steps for any additional PHP versions you want to install. This method allows you to have multiple PHP versions coexisting on your system and easily switch between them based on your project requirements.
