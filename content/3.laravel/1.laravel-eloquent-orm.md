# Laravel Eloquent ORM

[![N|Solid](https://laravel.com/img/logomark.min.svg)](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x)

Laravel includes Eloquent, an object-relational mapper (ORM) that makes it enjoyable to interact with your database. When using Eloquent, each database table has a corresponding "Model" that is used to interact with that table. In addition to retrieving records from the database table, Eloquent models allow you to insert, update, and delete records from the table as well.


This is a comprehensive guide to using Laravel's Eloquent ORM, covering various features and best practices. Here's a breakdown of each section:

1. **Introduction**: Provides an overview of Laravel's Eloquent ORM and its benefits.

2. **Features**: Lists key features of Eloquent ORM, such as relationships, query building methods, pagination, debugging, etc.

3. **Relationships**: Explains different types of relationships supported by Eloquent and demonstrates how to use them.

4. **withCount**: Shows how to use the `withCount` method to retrieve related models with a count of their related records.

5. **Where Any / All Clauses**: Explains how to use `whereAny` method to apply the same query constraints to multiple columns.

6. **Join Query**: Demonstrates how to perform left join and right join using `leftJoin` and `rightJoin` methods.

7. **subQuery**: Shows how to construct a where clause that compares the results of a subquery to a given value.

8. **Reuse or Clone query()**: Highlights the importance of cloning query instances for reusing them with different conditions.

9. **Map Query Results**: Illustrates how to map query results to a specific format using the `map` method.

10. **Pagination**: Explains different pagination methods available in Laravel (Simple Paginate, Paginate, Cursor Pagination) and provides best practices for mapping results during pagination.

Overall, it's a valuable resource for Laravel developers, covering both basic usage and advanced techniques.

## Relationship

| Name | Syntax |
| ------ | ------ |
| One to One | $this->hasOne(Modelname,’foreignKey’,’localKey’) |
| One to Many | $this->hasMany(Modelname,’foreignKey’,’localKey’) |
| Many to Many | $this->belongsToMany(Modelname,’foreignKey’,’localKey’) |
| Inverse one to one or many | $this->belongsTo(Modelname,’foreignKey’,’ownerKey’) |

Since all relationships also serve as query builders, you may add further constraints to the relationship query by calling the comments method and continuing to chain conditions onto the query:

```php
User::find(1)->personalDetail()->whereDate('created_at','2024-04-11')->first();
```
Output:
```sql
select * from `users` where `users`.`id` = '1' limit 1
select * from `personal_details` where `personal_details`.`user_id` = '1' and `personal_details`.`user_id` is not null and date('created_at') = '2024-04-11' and `personal_details`.`deleted_at` is null limit 1
```


## withCount

If you're combining withCount with a select statement, ensure that you call withCount after the select method:


```php
User::withCount('posts'=>function($q){
    $q->whereNotNull('release_date');
})->get();
```

## Where Any / All clauses

Sometimes you may need to apply the same query constraints to multiple columns. For example, you may want to retrieve all records where any columns in a given list are LIKE a given value. You may accomplish this using the whereAny method:

```php
$users = DB::table('users')
            ->where('active', true)
            ->whereAny([
                'name',
                'email',
                'phone',
            ], 'LIKE', 'Example%')
            ->get();
```

The query above will result in the following SQL:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE active = true AND (
    name LIKE 'Example%' OR
    email LIKE 'Example%' OR
    phone LIKE 'Example%'
)
```


## Join Query

If you would like to perform a "left join" or "right join" instead of an "inner join", use the leftJoin or rightJoin methods. These methods have the same signature as the join method:

```php
$users = DB::table('users')
            ->leftJoin('posts', 'users.id', '=', 'posts.user_id')
            ->get();
 
$users = DB::table('users')
            ->rightJoin('posts', 'users.id', '=', 'posts.user_id')
            ->get();
```


## subQuery

Sometimes you may need to construct a "where" clause that compares the results of a subquery to a given value. You may accomplish this by passing a closure and a value to the where method. For example, the following query will retrieve all users who have a recent "membership" of a given type

```php
$users = User::where(function (Builder $subquery){
            $subquery->select('user_id')
                    ->from('personal_details')
                    ->whereColumn('personal_details.user_id','users.id')
                    ->orderByDesc('personal_details.created_at')
                    ->limit(1);
        },'1')->get();
```

## Reuse or clone query()

WRONG WAY
```php
$query = Product::query();

$today = request()->q_date ?? today();
if($today){
    $query->where('created_at',$today);
}
// get active and inactive record
$active_products = $query->where('status',1)->get();
$inactive_products = $query->where('status',0)->get();
```

RIGHT WAY
```php
$active_products = $query->clone()->where('status',1)->get();
$inactive_products = $query->clone()->where('status',0)->get();
```


## Map Query Results

```php
$users = User::where('role_id',1)->get()->map(function(User $user){
    return [
        'id' => $user->id,
        'name' => $user->name,
        'email' => $user->email,
    ];
});

```

## Pagination



| Simple Paginate | Paginate | Cursor Pagination |
| ------ | ------ | ----- |
| Efficient for basic pagination | Offers more customization options | Specifically designed for efficiently |
| suitable for large datasets | suitable for a wider range of pagination needs | paginating large datasets without relying on offsets |
| but doesn't provide access to the total number of records | provides access to the total number of records | but doesn't provide access to the total number of records |


Map In Pagination

Don't use this code
```php
$users = User::with('personalDetail')->paginate(10)->map(function($employee){
    return [
        'id' => $employee->id,
        'name' => $employee->name,
    ];
});
```

Do this code
```php
$users = User::with('personalDetail')->paginate(10)->through(function($employee){
    return [
        'id' => $employee->id,
        'name' => $employee->name,
    ];
});
```


## Aggregate Functions

Aggregate functions in Eloquent allow you to perform calculations on sets of values. Here's an example demonstrating the use of aggregate functions:

```php
// Get the total number of users
$totalUsers = User::count();

// Get the average age of users
$averageAge = User::average('age');

// Get the maximum salary of employees
$maxSalary = Employee::max('salary');

// Get the total sum of sales
$totalSales = Sale::sum('amount');
```

In these examples:
- `count()` returns the total count of records.
- `average('column')` calculates the average value of a given column.
- `max('column')` finds the maximum value of a given column.
- `sum('column')` calculates the total sum of values in a given column.

Aggregate functions are handy for obtaining summary information from your database.

## Alias

Aliases in Eloquent allow you to give custom names to columns or tables in your queries. This can make your queries more readable or help resolve naming conflicts. Here's an example using aliases:

```php
// Selecting columns with aliases
$users = User::select('id as user_id', 'name as full_name')->get();

// Joining tables with aliases
$posts = Post::join('users as u', 'posts.user_id', '=', 'u.id')
             ->select('posts.*', 'u.name as author_name')
             ->get();
```

In these examples:
- `as` is used to define aliases for columns or tables.
- Aliases make it clear what each column or table represents, improving readability.
- Aliases can also be useful when joining tables with similar column names.

By using aliases, you can make your queries more expressive and easier to understand.


In SQL, `CASE` statements are often used to conditionally generate values or perform logic within a query. In Eloquent, you can use `DB::raw()` to include raw SQL expressions, including `CASE` statements, for creating aliases. Here's how you can use `CASE` statements for aliasing in Eloquent:

```php
// Example: Assign a user type based on role
$users = User::select(
        'id',
        'name',
        'email',
        DB::raw("CASE 
                    WHEN role = 'admin' THEN 'Administrator'
                    WHEN role = 'manager' THEN 'Manager'
                    ELSE 'User'
                END AS user_type")
    )
    ->get();
```

In this example:
- We're using `DB::raw()` to include a raw SQL expression within the `select` statement.
- Inside the `CASE` statement, we define conditions and corresponding values to be returned based on the value of the `role` column.
- The result of the `CASE` statement is aliased as `user_type`.

Similarly, you can use `IF` statements in MySQL to achieve similar results. Here's an example of using `IF`:

```php
// Example: Assign a user type based on role using IF statement
$users = User::select(
        'id',
        'name',
        'email',
        DB::raw("IF(role = 'admin', 'Administrator', IF(role = 'manager', 'Manager', 'User')) AS user_type")
    )
    ->get();
```

In this example:
- We're using the `IF` function within `DB::raw()` to achieve conditional logic.
- The `IF` function takes three arguments: a condition, a value to return if the condition is true, and a value to return if the condition is false.

Using `CASE` or `IF` statements in this manner allows you to perform conditional logic directly within your Eloquent queries and alias the results for clarity and readability.
