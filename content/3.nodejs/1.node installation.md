To install Node.js on Ubuntu 20.04, you can use the NodeSource repository or the official Ubuntu repository. Here, I'll guide you through the steps for both methods.

### Method 1: Using NodeSource Repository

1. Open a terminal on your Ubuntu 20.04 system.

2. Update the package list to ensure you have the latest information about available packages:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    ```

3. Install the dependencies needed for the NodeSource repository setup:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install -y curl software-properties-common
    ```

4. Add the Node.js 14.x repository:

    ```bash
    curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
    ```

   Note: You can replace `14.x` with the desired Node.js version.

5. Install Node.js and npm:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install -y nodejs
    ```

6. Verify that Node.js and npm are installed successfully:

    ```bash
    node -v
    npm -v
    ```

### Method 2: Using Ubuntu Repositories

1. Open a terminal on your Ubuntu 20.04 system.

2. Update the package list to ensure you have the latest information about available packages:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    ```

3. Install Node.js and npm from the default Ubuntu repositories:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install -y nodejs npm
    ```

4. Verify that Node.js and npm are installed successfully:

    ```bash
    node -v
    npm -v
    ```

Once you've completed either of the methods, you should have Node.js and npm installed on your Ubuntu 20.04 system. You can start using them to run JavaScript applications and manage packages.
