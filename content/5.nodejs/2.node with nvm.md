Certainly! The Node Version Manager (NVM) is a handy tool for managing multiple versions of Node.js on your system. Here are the steps to install Node.js using NVM on Ubuntu 20.04:

1. Open a terminal on your Ubuntu 20.04 system.

2. Update your package list:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    ```

3. Install some dependencies that NVM will use:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install -y curl wget build-essential libssl-dev
    ```

4. Install NVM using curl. This command will download and run the installation script:

    ```bash
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
    ```

   Make sure to check the [NVM GitHub repository](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for the latest version of the installation script.

5. Close and reopen your terminal or run the following command to apply the changes:

    ```bash
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

   If you're using Zsh, you might need to add the following line to your `~/.zshrc` file instead:

    ```bash
    source ~/.zshrc
    ```

6. Verify that NVM is installed:

    ```bash
    nvm --version
    ```

7. Install a specific version of Node.js using NVM. For example, to install Node.js version 14, you can run:

    ```bash
    nvm install 14
    ```

   Replace `14` with the version you want.

8. Set the default Node.js version to use:

    ```bash
    nvm use 14
    ```

   You can also set a default version for new shells by using:

    ```bash
    nvm alias default 14
    ```

9. Verify that Node.js and npm are installed successfully:

    ```bash
    node -v
    npm -v
    ```

Now you have Node.js installed using NVM, and you can easily switch between different Node.js versions using the `nvm use` command.
