# Setting Up a WordPress Project with a Bash Script: A Step-by-Step Guide

Installing and configuring WordPress for web development or blogging purposes can sometimes be a tedious process. This script streamlines the setup process by automating the download and installation of WordPress into a specified folder on a Linux-based server. Below is a breakdown of how this script works and what it accomplishes.

## Script Overview

The script begins by capturing a user-defined project folder name. It then checks if a name was provided and proceeds to create the project folder, if necessary. Once the project folder is prepared, the script downloads and extracts the latest version of WordPress, and moves the files into the specified project folder. Finally, it cleans up by removing any temporary files used during the setup process.

## Script Breakdown

1. **Getting User Input**
   - The script requires a folder name to be provided as a command-line argument. This name is used to create a new project folder under `/var/www/html/`.

2. **Checking for a Folder Name**
   - If the user doesn't provide a folder name, the script exits with a message prompting the user to do so.

3. **Creating the Project Folder**
   - If the specified project folder does not exist, the script creates it using `mkdir -p` to ensure the complete path is created if needed.

4. **Downloading and Unpacking WordPress**
   - The script uses `wget` to download the latest WordPress release as a zip file and `unzip` to extract the contents.
   - The extracted files are moved to the newly created project folder.

5. **Cleaning Up Temporary Files**
   - After the WordPress files are relocated, the script removes the temporary folder created during extraction and the downloaded zip file.

6. **Completion Message**
   - Once the setup is complete, the script outputs a success message, indicating where WordPress has been installed.

## Using the Script

To use this script, ensure you have the necessary permissions to write to `/var/www/html/`. The script must be executed with sufficient privileges, typically via `sudo`, to create directories and move files to the desired location. Below is an example command to run the script:

```bash
sudo bash install_wordpress.sh my_blog
```

In this example, the script creates a new WordPress installation in `/var/www/html/my_blog`. Once the script completes, WordPress is installed and ready for configuration, allowing you to quickly start building your website or blog.

## Conclusion

This Bash script provides a simple and efficient way to set up a WordPress project on a Linux-based server. It eliminates the need for manual downloads and file manipulations, making the setup process straightforward and reproducible. By automating these steps, users can focus more on building their WordPress sites and less on the initial setup.
