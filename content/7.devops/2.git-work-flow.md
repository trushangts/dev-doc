To minimize Git conflicts and maintain a smooth workflow for your development team, it's crucial to establish a structured process. 
Below is a set of commands and best practices to share with your team to ensure a streamlined and conflict-free experience.

### Workflow Steps and Commands

1. **Cloning the Repository**
   Ensure that each developer clones the repository only once.
   ```sh
   git clone https://your-repo-url.git
   cd your-repo-folder
   ```

2. **Setting Up the Repository**
   Check the branches and set up tracking for remote branches if needed.
   ```sh
   git branch -a
   ```

3. **Creating and Switching to a Feature Branch**
   Each developer should create their own feature branch based on the `devapi` branch.
   ```sh
   git checkout devapi
   git pull origin devapi
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. **Regularly Pulling Changes from `devapi`**
   Developers should frequently pull changes from the `devapi` branch to keep their feature branch updated.
   ```sh
   git checkout devapi
   git pull origin devapi
   git checkout feature/your-feature-name
   git merge devapi
   ```

5. **Resolving Conflicts**
   If conflicts occur during the merge, resolve them, then continue the merge process.
   ```sh
   # Resolve conflicts using a text editor or an IDE
   git add .
   git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
   ```

6. **Committing Changes**
   Commit your changes with a clear message.
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Detailed message about the changes"
   ```

7. **Pushing the Feature Branch**
   Push the feature branch to the remote repository.
   ```sh
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

8. **Creating a Pull Request**
   Create a pull request (PR) from your feature branch to the `devapi` branch and request a review from your team.

9. **Merging Pull Requests**
   Once the PR is approved and passes all checks, merge it into the `devapi` branch. Make sure to update your local `devapi` branch after a merge.
   ```sh
   git checkout devapi
   git pull origin devapi
   ```

10. **Deleting Merged Branches**
    After merging, delete the feature branch both locally and remotely to keep the repository clean.
    ```sh
    git branch -d feature/your-feature-name
    git push origin --delete feature/your-feature-name
    ```

### Best Practices

1. **Frequent Communication**
   Encourage developers to communicate frequently about the features they are working on to avoid overlapping changes.

2. **Small, Incremental Changes**
   Smaller changes are easier to review and merge, reducing the likelihood of conflicts.

3. **Code Reviews**
   Implement a robust code review process where at least one other developer reviews the code before merging.

4. **Automated Testing**
   Set up automated tests to run on each PR to catch issues early.

5. **Documentation**
   Maintain clear documentation about the workflow and keep it updated.

### Example Workflow Summary for Developers

1. Clone the repo:
   ```sh
   git clone https://your-repo-url.git
   cd your-repo-folder
   ```

2. Create and switch to a feature branch:
   ```sh
   git checkout devapi
   git pull origin devapi
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

3. Regularly update the feature branch:
   ```sh
   git checkout devapi
   git pull origin devapi
   git checkout feature/your-feature-name
   git merge devapi
   ```

4. Commit and push changes:
   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Detailed message about the changes"
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. Create a pull request and request a review.

6. After approval and merge, clean up: (Ask to TL for delete process for project wise)
   ```sh
   git checkout devapi
   git pull origin devapi
   git branch -d feature/your-feature-name
   git push origin --delete feature/your-feature-name
   ```

By following these steps and best practices, your team should be able to minimize Git conflicts and maintain a smooth development workflow.
