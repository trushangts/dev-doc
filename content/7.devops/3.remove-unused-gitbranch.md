Sure, here's a step-by-step guide on how to set up and run this script on an Ubuntu system, which you can share with your team.

### Step-by-Step Guide to Set Up and Run the Script

1. **Open Terminal**:
   - Press `Ctrl + Alt + T` to open a terminal window.

2. **Create the Script File**:
   - Navigate to your home directory or any directory where you want to create the script:
     ```bash
     cd ~
     ```

   - Create a new script file using a text editor, such as `nano`:
     ```bash
     nano backup_branches.sh
     ```

3. **Copy and Paste the Script**:
   - Copy the following script and paste it into the `nano` editor:

     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash

     # Variables
     REPO_DIR="/var/www/html/PMP-API"  # Replace with your repository path
     PROJECT_NAME="PMP-API"            # Replace with your project name
     CURRENT_DATE=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d")
     BACKUP_DIR="$HOME/Downloads/${PROJECT_NAME}-GIT-$CURRENT_DATE"  # Destination directory

     # Ensure the backup directory exists
     mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

     # Navigate to the repository directory
     cd "$REPO_DIR" || { echo "Repository directory not found"; exit 1; }

     # Remove any existing lock file
     rm -f .git/index.lock

     # Fetch all branches
     git fetch --all

     # List all branches
     branches=$(git branch -r | grep -v '\->')

     for branch in $branches; do
       # Remove remote name from branch
       branch_name=${branch#origin/}

       # Checkout the branch
       git checkout "$branch_name" || { echo "Failed to checkout branch: $branch_name"; continue; }

       # Create zip archive
       zip_file="$BACKUP_DIR/$branch_name.zip"
       zip -r "$zip_file" . || { echo "Failed to create zip file: $zip_file"; continue; }
     done

     # Checkout back to the main branch (or any default branch)
     git checkout main || { echo "Failed to checkout main branch"; exit 1; }
     ```

   - Save the file and exit `nano`:
     - Press `Ctrl + O` to save the file.
     - Press `Enter` to confirm the filename.
     - Press `Ctrl + X` to exit the editor.

4. **Make the Script Executable**:
   - Change the file permissions to make the script executable:
     ```bash
     chmod +x backup_branches.sh
     ```

5. **Run the Script**:
   - Execute the script:
     ```bash
     ./backup_branches.sh
     ```

6. **Verify the Backups**:
   - After the script completes, navigate to the `Downloads` directory to verify that the backup folders and zip files have been created:
     ```bash
     cd ~/Downloads
     ls -l
     ```

### Key Points to Explain to Your Team:

- **Script Location**:
  - The script should be saved in a location where the user has write access, such as the home directory.

- **Variables to Update**:
  - `REPO_DIR`: The path to the Git repository.
  - `PROJECT_NAME`: The name of the project.

- **Running the Script**:
  - Ensure the script is made executable with `chmod +x`.
  - Run the script using `./backup_branches.sh`.

- **Backup Location**:
  - The backups will be stored in the `Downloads` directory under a folder named `${PROJECT_NAME}-GIT-${CURRENT_DATE}`.

This guide should help you and your team set up and use the script effectively. If any team members encounter issues, make sure they check the repository path and ensure they have the necessary permissions to read the repository and write to the `Downloads` directory.
